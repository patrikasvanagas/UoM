PHYS20161 1st assignment: Bouncy Ball

This program investigates situation when a ball is droped from a specified
initial height and after each bounce the ball returns to a height that is
its previous maximum times a constant which is from 0 to 1. The user is asked
to input the initial height, a minimum height of interest and the bounce
constant. The program validates all inputs and calculates how many times the
ball will bounce above the specified minimum height and the time these bounces
will take. Optionally, the user can choose to plot a graph for height vs time
for this process.
